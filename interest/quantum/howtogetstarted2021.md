# How to get started in quantum computing, David Matthews, Nature, vol 591, 4 Mar 2021.

It's short, just 2 pages.
Nothing much either.
> "Yet that prospect remains a distant one. Even the fastest quantum computers today have no more than 100 qubits 
> and are plagued by **random errors**."
> "In 2019, Google demonstrated that its 54-qubit quantum computer could solve in minutes a problem that would take a classical machine 10,000 years.
> But this 'quantum advantage' applied only to an extremely narrow situation."

> "... computers will need several thousand qubits before they can usefully model chemical systems."

> "Most of the work done now is to prove that quantum, in the future may have the ability to solve interesting problems."

> "Quantum computing is essentially matrix vector multiplication - it's linear algebra underneath the hood"

> " ... **stray background heat** or **magnetic fields** can easily knock qubits out of their existing state."

  * quantum developer kit (with emulator): [Microsoft QDK](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/development-kit/quantum-computing/)
    * "[Thomas O'Brien] would suggest to anyone: start on a emulator ... [An] emulator is much more predictable. ... But scientists should still run their programs on a real quantum computer if they can ... to get used to their **noisy**, **error-prone behavior**."
